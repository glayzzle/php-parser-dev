WordPress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I&#8217;m proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into WordPress, and we&#8217;re dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right\">&#8212; Matt Mullenweg<\/p>\n\n<h2>Installation: Famous 5-minute install<\/h2>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.<\/li>\n\t<li>Open <span class=\"file\"><a href=\"wp-admin\/install.php\">wp-admin\/install.php<\/a><\/span> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>wp-config.php<\/code> file with your database connection details.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>If for some reason this doesn&#8217;t work, don&#8217;t worry. It doesn&#8217;t work on all web hosts. Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php<\/code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php<\/code> and upload it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Open <span class=\"file\"><a href=\"wp-admin\/install.php\">wp-admin\/install.php<\/a><\/span> in your browser.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <code>wp-config.php<\/code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/\" title=\"WordPress support\">support forums<\/a> with as much data as you can gather.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you.<\/strong> If you did not provide a username, it will be <code>admin<\/code>.<\/li>\n\t<li>The installer should then send you to the <a href=\"wp-login.php\">login page<\/a>. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on &#8220;Profile&#8221; to change the password.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<h2>Updating<\/h2>\n<h3>Using the Automatic Updater<\/h3>\n<p>If you are updating from version 2.7 or higher, you can use the automatic updater:<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Open <span class=\"file\"><a href=\"wp-admin\/update-core.php\">wp-admin\/update-core.php<\/a><\/span> in your browser and follow the instructions.<\/li>\n\t<li>You wanted more, perhaps?
